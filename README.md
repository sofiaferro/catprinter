![Cat Printer](./media/hackoclock.jpg)

Cat printer is a portable thermal printer sold on AliExpress for around $20.

This repository contains Python code for talking to the cat printer over Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). The code has been reverse engineered from the [official Android app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.frogtosea.iprint&hl=en_US&gl=US).

# Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository.
$ git clone git@github.com:rbaron/catprinter.git
$ cd catprinter
# Create a virtualenv on venv/ and activate it.
$ virtualenv --python=python3 venv
$ source venv/bin/activate
# Install requirements from requirements.txt.
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

# Usage
```bash
$ ./print.py --help
usage: print.py [-h] [-l {debug,info,warn,error}] [-b {mean-threshold,floyd-steinberg,atkinson,halftone,none}] [-s] [-d DEVICE] [-e ENERGY] [--no-resize]
                filename

prints an image on your cat thermal printer

positional arguments:
  filename

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -l {debug,info,warn,error}, --log-level {debug,info,warn,error}
  -b {mean-threshold,floyd-steinberg,atkinson,halftone,none}, --img-binarization-algo {mean-threshold,floyd-steinberg,atkinson,halftone,none}
                        Which image binarization algorithm to use. If 'none' is used, no binarization will be used. In this case the image has to
                        have a width of 384 px.
  -s, --show-preview    If set, displays the final image and asks the user for confirmation before printing.
  -d DEVICE, --device DEVICE
                        The printer's Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) address (MAC address on Linux; UUID on macOS) or advertisement name (e.g.:
                        "GT01", "GB02", "GB03"). If omitted, the the script will try to auto discover the printer based on its advertised BLE
                        services.
  -e ENERGY, --energy ENERGY
                        Thermal energy. Between 0x0000 (light) and 0xffff (darker, default).
  --no-resize           Disable automatic image resizing. Small images print as-is, 
                        large images scale to width without changing height.
```

# New Features

## Image Resize Control

The `--no-resize` option provides more control over image printing:

- By default, images are resized to match printer width
- With `--no-resize`, small images print at original size
- Large images are scaled to width while maintaining aspect ratio

Example:

```bash
# Print without automatic resizing
./print.py --no-resize test.png
```

## Printer Keep-Awake
A keep-awake mechanism can be configured in the manager project to prevent printer sleep mode. This is typically managed externally and can be activated when running the server.

```bash
# Managed by parent project
node server.js --keep-awake
```

# Example
```bash
% ./print.py --show-preview test.png
